This repository contains the coding exercise

## *Requisites* : Gradle, JDK 8 or higher

### Steps to get Started:
 - Clone the Repository
 - Run the Main Method in [LotsProcessor](https://github.com/nikhilncr/coding-exercice-Feb-26-2019/blob/master/src/main/java/entry/LotsProcessor.java)
 - Data Structure Solution [LotsSet](https://github.com/nikhilncr/coding-exercice-Feb-26-2019/blob/master/src/main/java/model/LotsSet.java)
 - [JSON file](https://github.com/nikhilncr/coding-exercice-Feb-26-2019/blob/master/src/main/resources/test.json) present in resources
 
 ### Over View : 
Return Lot given the lotNumber : ```Time Complexity O(N)  |  Space Complexity : O(1)```

Sort the Lots based on profit: ``` Time Complexity O(N log N)  |  Space Complexity : O(N) ```

Get Seller id with highest sales by Volume: ``` Time Complexity O(N)  |  Space Complexity : O(S) ``` 

Get Seller id who caused the highest net profit to the organization: ``` Time Complexity O(N)  |  Space Complexity : O(S) ```

``` N is number of uniqueLotNumbers and S is unique number of sellers ```
